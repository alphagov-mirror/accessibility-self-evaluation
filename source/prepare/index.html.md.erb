# Preparing to do a basic accessibility check

You don’t need to check every page of your website - just a sample. So start by working out which sample of content you’re going to check.

If you’ve got more than one website or app, you need to gather a sample from each website or app you have.

Your sample needs to include:

+ content pages that are mostly text based
+ images, video and audio content
+ interactive tools and transactions, like forms
+ PDFs and other document types you have
+ dynamic content like pop-up windows
+ navigation pages

You should also include in your sample any pages or websites containing information about accessibility, how to contact you, how to use your site, and any settings or preferences pages.

Once you’ve got your sample, work through the checks outlined in this guidance one by one.

It’s likely the checks will take at least a few days, so make sure to give yourself enough time to work through them.

Some of the requirements might not apply to your website. For example, if you don’t have any videos then you won’t be able to carry out any of the tests relating to video content.
