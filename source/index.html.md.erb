# Doing a basic accessibility check if you can’t do a detailed one

The first step towards meeting [the new accessibility requirements](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps) involves evaluating how accessible your website is.

This means checking whether or not it meets the [international WCAG 2.1 AA standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag).

Checking this in detail requires a large amount of technical expertise and is best left to either:

+ an accessibility expert within your organisation
+ a third-party accessibility auditor

Some organisations won’t have the expertise to do a detailed check themselves and paying a third party would place a ‘disproportionate burden’ on them. This means a burden or cost that is too much for the organisation to reasonably bear.

If this applies to your organisation, you’ll have to do a basic check instead. This guide will help you to do that basic check.

The checks outlined in this guidance can be done by anyone with a basic knowledge of websites - any web officers in your organisation or volunteers, for example.

> Before you start, [check whether it’s reasonable for you to do a detailed accessibility check instead](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement#decide-how-to-check-your-website-or-app-for-accessibility-problems). If it is, then just doing a basic check won’t be enough for you to meet the requirements.
