# 1. Text content

You’ll need to start by checking the text-based content pages (and any PDFs or other documents) you included in your sample.

## Check content is marked up properly

It’s important that your content is marked up correctly. This is because some users with visual impairments use tools called ‘screen readers’ that read out page content to them.

Things like lists and headings need to be marked up in a way that allows screen readers to tell what they are and how your content is structured.

You’ll be able to check some of these things in your content management system. For instance, you can check to see whether any headings are marked up with ```<h2>``` or ```<h3>``` tags, or ```##``` and ```###``` if you’re using markdown. Headings shouldn’t just be marked up in bold.

You might need to look at the page HTML to check things like tables or bullet lists. How you do this depends on which browser you’re using. If you’re using:

+ Google Chrome, right-click a table or bullet list and select ‘inspect’
+ Safari, right-click a table or bullet list and select ‘inspect element’ - you might need to [enable Safari developer tools](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/Web_Inspector_Tutorial/EnableWebInspector/EnableWebInspector.html) first
+ Edge, click ‘F12’ to open the developer tab and then hold ‘Ctrl’ and ‘B’ - once you’ve done that, left-click on a table or bullet list to inspect the HTML
+ Firefox, right-click a table or bullet list and select ‘inspect element’ - you might need to [enable Firefox web developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Open_the_Inspector) first

Once that’s done, look out for the following sorts of tags:

+ for tables, look out for ```<td>```, ```<th>``` and ```<tr>```
+ for bullet lists, look out for ```<ul>``` and ```<li>```

If you can see these tags, it’s likely your content is marked up properly.

To check PDFs or other documents, open them in the tool used to create them and check that:

+ headings are marked up properly, using the proper document structure settings like the [styles gallery in Microsoft Word](https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/add-a-heading-3eb8b917-56dc-4a17-891a-a026b2c790f2)
+ tables and bullet points are properly styled - for instance, you’re not just using hyphens for bullet lists

## Check pages are usable when stylesheets are disabled

A stylesheet defines the visual layout of a web page. Your content still needs to be usable even if stylesheets are disabled.

You can test this by copying a URL from your website and pasting it into the [WAVE tool](http://wave.webaim.org/). Once you’ve done that, select ‘no styles’ from the panel on the left-hand side of the tool. This should give you a much more basic view of the page.

Repeat this process with all your sample content pages and check whether they’re still usable. This means it’s still possible to complete any relevant tasks or find important information - for example, look for opening hours or contact details, or navigate your way to a form you need to fill out.

You won’t be able to do this test on PDFs or other document types.

## Check that instructions are styled properly

You need to make sure you’re not conveying instructions in a way that relies on a user’s ability to see the page.

For example, only sighted users will understand instructions like:

+ ‘click the round button’
+ ‘click the big button below’
+ ‘click the red button’

Users who can’t see the page won’t know what you’re referring to, because instructions like that rely on you being able to see the page.

So check your sample of pages and look out for these types of instructions.

## Check that links make sense

Check any links on your sample content pages to check that the link text you’re using clearly explains where any links will take the user.

This is important because screen reader users often scan through lists of links in isolation. This means they don’t have the surrounding context to help them understand what the link is for.

You can check your links by looking at your sample pages and just reading the link text - without paying attention to the surrounding content. If the links still make sense even in isolation and clearly explain where the links go, it’s likely the text you’re using is accessible.

If you’re using link text like ‘click here’ or ‘more information’ then you’re probably not meeting this requirement - link text like that doesn’t describe where the link will go or what it’s for.

There’s [guidance explaining what good link text looks like](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/links#writing-link-text) if you’re not sure.

## Check that pages have good titles

You need to check your pages are titled properly. If they’re not, users won’t understand what they’re for and will struggle to find what they need using search.

Your page title should appear in the page tab at the top of your browser. For instance, if you go to [the GOV.UK homepage](https://www.gov.uk/) you’ll see the text in the tab near the top of the browser is ‘Welcome to GOV.UK’. This is the page title.

Look at the equivalent text for your sample pages. You can hover over the tab to see the full text if it’s too long to fit on the tab itself.

Check whether your titles are descriptive. Ask yourself whether they clearly state - in simple language - what the pages are about and the tasks they’d help users complete.

For example, ‘Apply for a blue badge’ is a much more descriptive title than just ‘Blue badges’.

Also check that none of the titles are duplicated: if two pages have the same title, how is the user supposed to know which one to use?

There’s [guidance on writing good page titles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk) if you need help.

## Check the language the content is written in

A screen reader needs to know what language a page is written in so it uses the correct speech libraries for accent and pronunciation. It only knows this if the language is specified in the page HTML.

You’ll need to check the HTML of your sample content pages to see whether your website does this. To inspect the page HTML, use the same method you used when checking whether your content was marked up appropriately.

Once you’ve opened the HTML, scroll to the top of the panel. You should see a ```<!doctype html>``` tag. Directly under that you should see an ‘<html lang=”’ tag. This is where the screen reader finds out the page language.

If the page is written in English, the tag should read ```<html lang=“en”``` or ```<html lang=en-gb```. If it’s empty, the screen reader won’t be able to tell what language the page is in.

If any of your sample pages contain content written in other languages, you’ll need to check that’s marked up properly too, using the [country code for the relevant language](https://www.sitepoint.com/iso-2-letter-language-codes/).
