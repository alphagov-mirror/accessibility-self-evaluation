# 1. Text content

You’ll need to start by checking the text-based content pages you included in your sample.

## Check you're using proper headings

It’s important that any headings you’re using are styled properly. This is because some users with visual impairments use tools called ‘screen readers’ that read out page content to them.

Screen reader users often scan through the list of headings in a document so they can skip to the content they’re looking for.  

If you’re styling headings just by using bold, or by using bigger font, then screen readers won’t recognise them as headings and users won’t be able to skip to the content they need. 

To check your headings are styled propely, open up the tool you use to edit your website (often known as a ‘content management system’) and check the headings on your sample pages. They’re style correctly if something like one of the following applies:

+ your headings are styled as things like ‘Heading level 2’, rather than ‘Normal text’
+ you can see tags like ``##``, ``###``, ``<H2>`` or ``<H3>``

## Check pages are usable when stylesheets are disabled

The way a page looks is controlled by something called a ‘stylesheet’. It defines things like the way a page is laid out and any font colours. 

Your content still needs to be usable even if stylesheets are disabled. This means it’s still possible to complete any relevant tasks or find important information - for example, look for opening hours or contact details, or navigate your way to a form you need to fill out.

You’ll need to check this applies to your sample pages. Test this by copying a URL from your website and pasting it into the [WAVE tool](http://wave.webaim.org/). Once you’ve done that, select ‘no styles’ from the panel on the left-hand side of the tool. This should give you a much more basic view of the page.

If you can still complete any relevant tasks then it’s likely you’re meeting this requirement.

## Check that instructions are styled properly

You need to make sure you’re not conveying instructions in a way that relies on a user’s ability to see the page.

For example, only sighted users will understand instructions like:

+ ‘click the round button’
+ ‘click the big button below’
+ ‘click the red button’

Users who can’t see the page won’t know what you’re referring to, because instructions like that rely on you being able to see the page.

So check your sample of pages and look out for these types of instructions.

## Check that links make sense

Check any links on your sample content pages to check that the link text you’re using clearly explains where any links will take the user.

This is important because screen reader users often scan through lists of links in isolation. This means they don’t have the surrounding context to help them understand what the link is for.

You can check your links by looking at your sample pages and just reading the link text - without paying attention to the surrounding content. If the links still make sense even in isolation and clearly explain where the links go, it’s likely the text you’re using is accessible.

If you’re using link text like ‘click here’ or ‘more information’ then you’re probably not meeting this requirement - link text like that doesn’t describe where the link will go or what it’s for.

## Check that pages have good titles

You need to check your pages are titled properly. If they’re not, users won’t understand what they’re for and will struggle to find what they need using search.

Your page title should appear in the page tab at the top of your browser. For instance, if you go to [the GOV.UK homepage](https://www.gov.uk/) you’ll see the text in the tab near the top of the browser is ‘Welcome to GOV.UK’. This is the page title.

Look at the equivalent text for your sample pages. You can hover over the tab to see the full text if it’s too long to fit on the tab itself.

Check whether your titles are descriptive. Ask yourself whether they clearly state - in simple language - what the pages are about and the tasks they’d help users complete.

For example, ‘Apply for a blue badge’ is a much more descriptive title than just ‘Blue badges’.

Also check that none of the titles are duplicated: if two pages have the same title, how is the user supposed to know which one to use?
