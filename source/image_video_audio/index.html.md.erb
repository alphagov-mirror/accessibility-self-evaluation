# 2.  Images, video and audio content

There are a series of things you’ll need to do to check that your sample of images and video content is accessible. 

## Check any images are described in the page copy

You’ll need to check that any non-decorative images (including charts or diagrams) have an accompanying text description. That way, users who can’t see the image can still access the information they convey. 

Take your sample pages and check that any images either:

+ have appropriate [alternative (or ‘alt) text](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/image-copyright-standards-for-gov-uk) that explains the information the image conveys - you can usually check this in the content management system you use to update your website
+ are described in any surrounding body text

## Check any video or audio content is properly described

As you did with your images, you’ll need to check that any videos or audio content are clearly described so that users who can’t see them can still access the information.

This firstly means checking that videos have captions. You should also check your sample videos (maybe 2 or 3) to assess the quality of those captions.

Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to check there are transcripts for any audio content you’ve got.

## Audio descriptions for video and audio content

When you check through the videos on your website, you might come across things that are covered in the video but not described in the audio track - something like the contents of a chart or graph, for example.

If you were only following the audio, you’d miss this information. So for your site to be fully accessible, you’d need to provide an extra audio description to describe anything not covered in the main audio track.

Check your sample of videos to see if an extra audio track is required and whether you’re providing one.

## Check for images containing text

You’ll need to check whether any of your sample images contain text. This is because screen readers won’t be able to read the text within the image. The information should be published as normal body text instead. 

This doesn’t include logos and brand names - it’s okay for those to contain text.
