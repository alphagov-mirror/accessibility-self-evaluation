# 2.  Images, video and audio content

There are a series of things you’ll need to do to check that your sample of images and video content is accessible. You should also do the image checks on any PDFs or other documents you included in your sample.

## Check any images are described in the page copy

You’ll need to check that your sample of images either:

+ have appropriate alternative (or ‘alt’) text that explains the information the image conveys
+ are described in any surrounding body text, so anyone who can’t see the images can still access the information the image conveys

You might be able to check and edit any alt text using your content management system (CMS).

If that doesn’t work, you can check it by inspecting the page HTML. Use the same method you used when checking whether your content was marked up properly.

Once you’ve opened up the HTML panel, inspect one of the images for alt text. If there is any, it’ll appear after the `<img alt=` tag.

## Check any video or audio content is properly described

As you did with your images, you’ll need to check that any videos or audio content are clearly described.

This firstly means checking that videos have captions. You should also check your sample videos (maybe 2 or 3) to assess the quality of those captions.

Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to check for transcripts for any audio content you’ve got.

## Audio descriptions for video and audio content

When you check through the videos on your website, you might come across things that are covered in the video but not described in the audio track - something like the contents of a chart or graph, for example.

If you were only following the audio, you’d miss this information. So for your site to be fully accessible, you’d need to provide an extra audio description to describe anything not covered in the main audio track.

Check your sample of videos to see if an extra audio track is required and whether you’re providing one.

## Check any video players are accessible

You need to check that any video players are accessible. This means checking that the buttons you need to use to interact with the video player are marked up in a way that a screen reader would recognise.

You’ll need to inspect the page HTML to check whether you’re meeting this requirement. Do this using the same method you used to check whether your text content was marked up properly.

Once you’ve done that, right-click (or left-click if you’re using Edge) one of the video player buttons and select ‘inspect’ or ‘inspect element’, depending on the browser you’re using.

Check whether the button’s been given a name like ‘Play’ or ‘Pause’ - if it has, the name will likely appear as part of a ‘title’ or ‘aria label’ tag.

If there’s no text indicating what the button does then it probably hasn’t been marked up properly. This means a screen reader won’t know what the button’s for and that users need to be able to see and understand the button icon to work it out for themselves.

## Check for images containing text

You’ll need to check whether any of your sample images contain text. This doesn’t include logos and brand names - it’s okay for those to contain text.
