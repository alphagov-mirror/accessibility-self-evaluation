# 3. Interactive tools and transactions

Once you’ve finished checking your images, video and audio content, you’ll need to check the forms you included in your sample. 

## Check form fields are marked up appropriately

You need to make sure any form fields are marked up correctly. If they aren’t, screen readers won’t be able to tell what a form field is for, or what information the user should enter into it.

You can check your form fields are marked up properly by going to a form and clicking on a field label (the text that explains what a particular form field is for). If the field is marked up correctly, clicking the field label should cause your cursor to appear inside the corresponding field.

You can see what this looks like using the [GOV.UK contact form](https://www.gov.uk/contact/govuk#do-you-want-a-reply). If you click on the ‘Your name’ field towards the bottom of the page, you’ll see the focus of your cursor switches to the field itself.

Do this test on a few of your forms to check whether the fields respond as they should.

## Check it’s clear what information users need to provide

As you go through your sample forms, you’ll need to check you’re using field labels in a way that makes clear what information the user needs to enter.

As a general rule, these labels should be specific. Look at your forms and make an assessment as to whether they’re clear. Common mistakes include not labelling fields at all, or using vague labels like ‘Name’ in a way that doesn’t make clear whose name the user needs to enter (for example, it could be a partner or child’s name, rather than the user’s own name).

## Check form elements are consistent across your website

When you’re checking through your forms, you’ll need to check that form labels are used consistently. These are the labels that describe the information a user needs to enter into a particular field.

Check your sample to see how you’re labelling the navigational elements. For instance, are you using ‘Submit’ on one form and then using ‘Go’ or ‘Complete’ on another?

Are you asking for users’ names and addresses in a consistent manner, or does it vary from form to form?

## Check that users can autofill information where appropriate

You need to make sure users can autofill information in forms where possible. For example, they should be able to autofill their name and address if their browser has saved this information.

Test this by filling out a form elsewhere on the internet - sign up for or order something online, or do your online shop.

Now come back to a form on your website. If you get the chance to autofill some or all of your address or personal details, then your website is meeting this requirement.

## Check users get a warning before they’re timed out

Some websites time users out after a period of inactivity. This usually results in form data being lost, or the user being automatically logged out of an account.

You need to make sure to warn users if you’re going to time them out after a period of inactivity. You’ll also need to give them the chance to interact with the page to prevent the time out from happening.

Test whether you’re doing this by going to one of the forms on your website and remaining inactive for around 20 minutes. If you get timed out with no warning, then you’re not meeting the requirements.

If, after a while, you were given a timeout warning and a chance to prevent the timeout by interacting with the page, you’re likely meeting the requirements.

## Check that any error messages are helpful

When a user provides incorrect information in a form, you need to let them know they’ve made a mistake and help them correct that mistake.

You can check how well your website is doing this by going to your sample forms and entering some intentionally incorrect or invalid information.

For example, you could enter a future date into a date of birth field or a postcode with too few characters and try submitting the form. This should generate an error message.

Assess whether the error messages make clear what you need to do to correct the mistakes. Messages like ‘invalid date’ or ‘invalid postcode’ aren’t very helpful: they indicate that the user has made a mistake, but don’t explain why the information was wrong and how to correct the error.

Something like ‘You can’t enter a date in the future - please enter a past date’ is much more helpful.

Play around with a few form fields to see how helpful the error messages are.

## Check users can review their answers before submitting a form

Users need to be able to check their answers before submitting certain types of form, to confirm they’ve entered the correct information. This only applies to forms where there would be serious consequences to them making a mistake - for example, financial transactions or something that enters them into a legal contract.

You can test this by going to any of your sample forms that meet these criteria and working your way through them. See if you’re presented with [a page that lets you check your answers](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/check-answers/) before submitting the form.

## Check that form elements behave as expected

When you were working your way through some of your sample forms, you should have noticed whether interacting with any of the elements caused anything unexpected to happen.

This includes things like a dropdown menu or radio button (an element that lets you select just one of a few options) causing a new page to open when you click on it.
